# Application Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for a troop management application. The system will include features for managing members, tracking contributions, registering activities, and calculating points for patrols. The plan is divided into logical phases to facilitate organized implementation and testing.

## Application Requirements

The application should include the following functionalities:

- A list of members with details like birth date and contact information (patrol leaders see their patrol members; leaders see everyone).
- Login module for patrol leaders, assistants, and leaders (each role has specific permissions).
- Management of contributions (patrol leaders see their patrol members; leaders see everyone).
- Submission of activity forms for troop and patrol meetings with automatic point calculations.
- Submission of forms for closing ranks/skills with automatic point calculations.
- Categorization by patrol leaders with automatic point calculations.
- Logs of all point-related activities.
- (Future) Management of ranks and patrols once the core system is operational.
